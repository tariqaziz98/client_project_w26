      <h2>Resume Templates and Formats</h2>
      <p>
        Getting started with your resume? UMSI-approved templates ensure your document is formatted correctly and optimized for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). These templates follow industry best practices and are designed to highlight your experiences effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Key formatting tips:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use a professional, easy-to-read font (Times New Roman, Cambria, Arial, or Garamond) in 10-12pt size</li>
        <li>Keep your resume to one page for most industry jobs, including consulting and technology roles</li>
        <li>Maintain consistent formatting throughout with margins of at least 0.5 inches</li>
        <li>Avoid headers, footers, tables, and fancy graphics that can confuse ATS systems</li>
        <li>Save your final document as a PDF after creating it in Microsoft Word or Google Docs</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Tailoring Your Resume for Success</h2>
      <p>
        One resume doesn't fit all opportunities. Successful job seekers maintain a <strong>master resume</strong>—a comprehensive document with all experiences—and create <strong>tailored resumes</strong> for specific positions.
      </p>
      <h3>How to Tailor Effectively</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Match keywords from the job description, especially tasks, qualifications, and desired outcomes</li>
        <li>Prioritize experiences that are most recent, relevant, and unique to the position</li>
        <li>Select 3-4 relevant courses or projects that demonstrate skills mentioned in the posting</li>
        <li>Adjust your bullet points to emphasize the skills the employer is seeking</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Use tools like <a href="https://www.resumeworded.com" target="_blank">Resume Worded</a> (free with your @umich.edu account) to compare your resume against job descriptions and identify missing keywords.
